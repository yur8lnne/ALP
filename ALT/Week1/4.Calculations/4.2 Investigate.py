# Starter code

num1 = 25
num2 = 4
print("Enter a number")
num3 = int(input())

total1 = num1 * num2
total2 = num3 + num2
total3 = total1 - total2

# How many variables are used in the code?
  # Answer: 6

# Give the line number where an output statement is used.
  # Answer: line5

# What symbol is used for variable assignment?
  # Answer: =

# What value is stored in total1 at the end of the program?
  # Answer: 100, total1 stores the multiple of two values which is stored in num1 and num2.

# What value is stored in num3 at the end of the program?
  # Answer: in num3 at the end of the program, it stores the integer that is inputed. For example, if the input number was 10, at the end of the program num3 will be storing integer 10. 

# Line 8 is changed to total1 = num1 // num2. How would it affect the program?
  # Answer: variable total3 stores the subtraction of total1 and total2, so it the value of total1 changes, the variable total3 will also change too.
