# Add comments to this code to predict what it will do.
print(8 + 2)
#it will print the sum of 8 and 2 and the output will be float 10.
print( 8 - 2)
#it will print the subtraction of 8and 2 and the output will be float 6.
print(8 * 2)
#it will print float 16.
print(10 / 4)
#it will print float 2.5
print(10 // 4)
#the output will be integer 2.

# This code uses variables in place of numbers in the calculation.  Add comments to explain how it works.

num1 = 20
num2 = 5

result = num1 * num2

print(result)
#At the first and second line, 20 and 5 is assigned into variables num1 and num2. So the variable result calculates with the numbers in the two variables and calculates 20*5. So the variable result stores 100, and the output of the overall code is 100, which was the integer that was stored in variable result.

# This code uses input to assign data into a variable.  Add comments to explain how it works.
print("Enter a number")
num1 = int(input())
num2 = 2

result = num1 // num2

print(result)
#The first two lines asks an question and gets an integer input for variable num1. The input number is stored in variable num1. The output will be the the value stored in variable result and in line28 the variable result gets assigned a integer of the result num1//num2. To conclude the output will be num1(the input number)//2.
