# Task Make
# Write a program that outputs a joke on multiple lines. 

print("What's orange and sounds like a parrot?\n\n\nA carrot!")

print("Why can't a bycicle stand by it own?\n\n\nBecause it is two-tired")

print("-------------------------------------------")

# Extension Task 1
print("Why can't a bycicle stand by it own?\n\n\nBecause it is two-tired")
# the '\n' helps to make multiple lines, so when we use \n we can change lines with writing only one print.
