#Predict and Run Example 1
 # Add comments to the code below to explain what it does
 # the variable firstname stores the string Andy, so print(firstName) prints out the stored string Andy as an output

firstName = "Andy"

print(firstName)

#Predict and Run Example 2
 # Add comments to the code below to explain what it does
 # as above the variable lastName stores the string Colley, and another variable named fullName stores the combination of two variables, Andy Colley. So it will print out Andy Colley. 

lastName = "Colley"

fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

print(fullName)

#Predict and Run Example 3
 # Add comments to the code below to explain what it does
 # the output would be, 'Hello Andy. Your full name is Andy Colly.'. (the output doesn't include quotes, I put it to easy to see)

print("Hello " + firstName + ". Your full name is " + fullName + ".")
