### Example Code 1

fName = "Mr"
lName = "Colley"

print(fName)

# Identify a variable in the code
 # Answer: fName, lName

# Identify a string in the code
 # Answer: Mr, Colley

# Line 4 is changed to lName = "Thorpe".  How does this affect the output?
 #Answer: the variable lName changes to the string Thorpe, but the output will be the string stored in variable named fName, so it doesn't affect the output and prints Colley. 

# Line 3 is changed to fName = "Mrs". How does this affect the output?
 # Answer: The string stored in variable fName would be changed into Mrs, so the output will change from Mr to the new stored string Mrs.


### Example Code 2

num1 = 20
num2 = 5

total1 = num1 + 15
total2 = num2 * 2
total3 = num1 - num2

print(total3)

# What will be output by the program?
 # Answer: 15


### Example Code 3

name1 = "Ross" 
name2 = "Monica" 
name3 = "Joey" 
name4 = "Rachel" 
name5 = "Chandler" 
 
print(name1 + " and " + name4) 
#print(name1, " and ", name5) 
print(name3) 
 
name3 = "Phoebe" 


# How many variables are used in the program?
 # Answer: 5

# What would be the impact of changing  print(name1, " and ", name4) to print(name1, " and ", name5) ?
 # Answer: the second code would print out the string stored in variable name5 insead of name4, so from the first code, the output will be Ross  and Rachel, and from the second code it would have an output Ross  and  Chandler.

# What is the purpose of the '+' symbol in  print(name1, " and ", name4) 
 # Answer: it is to add the strings into one so it can be printed as Ross and Rachel.

# The line  print(name3) is added to the end of the code.  Explain what it will do.
 # Answer: it will print out the string Joey. The variable name3 is changed into string Pheobe after the print(name3) code but as it is chaged after it doesn't affect the output above.
