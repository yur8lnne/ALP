#Task 1 - Add comments to the code below to predict what will happen when it is run.
#The first line will print Hi! What's your name? to ask the input. The next code appoints the string that is inputed to the variable name. 

#Task 2 - add comments to the code to explain what the variable(s) are called and where they are used. Make sure to show where the variable.
#The variable name is to get an input and use it to print out the output. 

print("Hi! What's your name?")

name = input()

print("Hi " + name + "! How are you today?")
